        <p>The line of people waiting for food at this Port Chester, New York pantry stretches around the block. On Thursdays, in a parking lot, 
            members of the John Second 3:16 Pentecostal Church deliver food: meats, fruits, vegetables, canned goods and even turkeys and apple 
            pie for Thanksgiving.
        </p>
        
        <p>Cinthya and Eliazer Quintana are the pastors of the church and are in charge of bringing the food and distributing it. Every 
            Thursday they deliver at least 800 packages. "It has always been in our hearts to help our community," says Quintana as her volunteers 
            begin to organize the delivery and unload the food trucks. "Before the pandemic, not so many people came and now we have to have more food 
            because the need is evident”, affirms the pastor. From hildren to elderly people of all races come to the pantry. "My heart rejoices to 
            be able to help people," she says.
        </p>
        
        <p>The lines are long and although the delivery starts at 11 in the morning, there are people waiting since 7am. The one who arrives first 
            has the option of bringing meat, so Rosa Medina, who did not reveal her real name, was in the line from before 9am. She lost her job 
            due to the pandemic and her husband does not work everyday during the winter. "It's a very big help, that's why I come to queue early," 
            says Rosa, a mother of four. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Whole families also attend, such as the Fernándezes, Peruvians who won a visa lottery and arrived in the United States a few 
            months ago and still cannot find a job. Davino Fernández, the father of a family, said that he came to this country to work and for his 
            children to have a better education. "One day I saw the line and decided to come and now I come every Thursday with my four children 
            and my husband," said Mercedes, the matriarch of the family. “This is a great help while we get jobs,” said the oldest daughter, 
            Ailyn Fernández.
        </p>

        <p>The Quintana pastors bring the food for the community from Feeding Westchester. Feeding Westchester partners with 300 pantries and food 
            banks and is led by Karen Erren, who came on as its CEO in July 2020, with the pandemic already raging.“Our neighbors who are hungry 
            are just like you and me, but they don't have the family network or the safety net that so many of us have,” Erren says. “Westchester 
            County is a very wealthy community, but alongside great wealth is great need, and that has always been true", Erren affirms.
